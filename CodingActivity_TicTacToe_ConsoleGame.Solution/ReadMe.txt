•	Create Account
•	Sign In

The user can Sign In to their account (If they have one) to continue playing where they last saved their progress during a previous session.
The user can choose to select a difficulty level which will determine the size of the gameboard.
If the user chooses to not to create an account, and instead to play a game immediately they can choose Play a New Round.
If for some reason the user decides to Quit playing the game they can select the menu option to terminate the application.
3. After the user selects Play a New Round, the Game Board is displayed and the player is given the option to place their piece on the board. Game play continues by alternating between each player, each one placing a player piece upon the board until a win is achieved or a cat’s game occurs. Once the round is complete the user is given the option of playing again or not. If the user selects the latter, the game ends and the application closes, if however, the user selects to play again, a new round begins.
